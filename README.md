## My Process


- I worked on the HTML first.


- Worked on CSS layout


- After having everything in its place, I began styling


- After styling, I then wanted to add a slideshow to my project. That's when I incorporated JavaScript code


- Lastly, I made a last minute decision to work on mobile first workflow. I should have started the CSS layout first for mobile devices *then* work on the desktop. But instead I started backwards. That will explain why my media device sizes have weird pixel sizes.
